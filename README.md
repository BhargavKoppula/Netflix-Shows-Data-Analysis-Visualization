# Netflix-Shows-Data-Analysis-Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a complete data analysis and visualization pipeline for Netflix shows. It covers:

✔ Data Cleaning in Python & SQL

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

✔ Data Visualization using Power BI

By the end of this project, we have a cleaned dataset and an interactive dashboard to explore Netflix show trends.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository contains the following files:

## 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Analysis

🔹 netflix_data.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook where:

Data was cleaned and processed using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed

Data was exported as a cleaned CSV

🔹 netflix_titles_stage.csv – The cleaned dataset obtained from Python.

## 2️⃣ SQL Data Cleaning

🔹 netflix_data_cleaning.sql – SQL script where:

Data cleaning was done using MySQL

Duplicate removal, missing value handling, and transformations were applied

Final cleaned dataset was exported

🔹 netflix_titles_cleaned.csv – The cleaned dataset obtained from SQL.

## 3️⃣ Data Visualization

🔹 netflix_data_visual.pbix – Power BI dashboard where:

The cleaned dataset was loaded

Key insights were visualized using bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs

Filters were added for interactivity

🔹 dashboard_screenshot.png – A preview of the Power BI dashboard.

## 🔍 Insights & Findings

Some key takeaways from the analysis:

Most common genres include Stand-up Comedy and TV Dramas.

TV-MA (Mature Audience) is the most frequent content rating.

The number of Netflix shows peaked around 2018-2019.

The majority of the content consists of Movies (69%) compared to TV Shows.

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

Open netflix_data_cleaning.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to check the Python-based cleaning and analysis.

Run netflix_data_cleaning.sql in MySQL Workbench to see SQL-based cleaning.

Load netflix_data_visual.pbix in Power BI to explore the interactive dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL: MySQL for data cleaning

Power BI: For data visualization
